Hello World!

My name is Jordan Del-Grande, and I live in Canberra, Australia. In 2012, I was endorsed as a Sifu of Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春氣功) directly by Sifu Gregory Choi, (previously Tsoi Shiu Kwong or Choy Siu Kwong), a closed-door student of Grand Master Yip Man (葉問宗師).

My interpretation of Sifu is someone who acts as a teacher and guide to the student, since a guide has already traveled the path. At times it can also mean master, but I see it not so much as a title, but as someone who has mastered a technique; so there is no sycophantic behaviour at my school – In fact, I personally frown upon it. Instead, mutual respect, sincerity and a humble learning attitude are all that are required, since the course is much like taking on an apprenticeship.

The apprentice model is the traditional way to learn Healing, Kung Fu and Qi Gong, since these arts are not something that can be mastered by simply reading books. To assist in speeding up the process of learning, I am personally available either in person, or online where you can see me, hear me and ask questions. Additionally, the stage-by-stage learning allows you to progress smoothly, effectively and in a very fast time frame, taking the guesswork out of a field that is ensnared with misinterpretation and hyperbole.

That is why it is with great pleasure to welcome you to the wonderful art of Wing Chun Qi Gong, a specially designed course expressing the multi-faceted and previously hidden teaching’s of Wing Chun’s Qi Gong, Nei Gong, Healing, and Advanced Kung Fu Techniques.
