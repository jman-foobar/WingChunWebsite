Wing Chun Qi Gong is an all inclusive Energy Cultivation, Kung Fu, Meditative and Healing School, with the lineage and practices dating back thousands of years across thousands of schools, traditions and continents such as India, China, and Tibet.

It’s very difficult to find one school that has all this to offer, instead of waiting years for the master to trust you before passing the knowledge along. Or worse still, false teachers manipulating students in master-slave relathipship.  

I don’t want to waste your time, so I begin disclosing this often hidden or unknown information from the very first lesson.

One of the best features of the course, is I have organised the advancement in a step-by-step fashion so you can progress smoothly but quickly through the basics to advanced stages of the art.

## Stages of Wing Chun Qi Gong
*Foundational Stages – Students can start from anyone of the three foundational stages*

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/3.-Wing-Chun-Small-Thought-Qi-Gong-Sui-Nim-Tao-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Small Thought Qi Gong - 詠春小念頭丹田氣功**

In our school, this stage is translated as the Way of Inner Silence to Cultivate Life Force Energy. This course has basic teachings that the student then learns to combine into a well-oiled machine that integrate with one another to create a sum far greater than the parts. So although Small Thought is usually the first practice taught, do not misunderstand the advanced nature of this form, as one will continue to return to it in amazement.

A special type of Yi Jin Jing (Muscle/Tendon Strengthening) Qi Gong (氣功) consisting of movements that strengthen the ‘whole’ body, stimulate the nervous system, endocrine system, prefrontal lobe, clear the mind and produce natural healing effects. It is a complete set of movements authentic to Wing Chun that provides numerous benefits, leading to an opening of the bodies energetic system.

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/2.-Wing-Chun-Internal-Treasure-Qi-Gong-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Internal Treasure Qi Gong – 詠春丹田氣功**

The student is introduced to cultivating the internal elixir through Nei Gung (內氣功) cultivation techniques found in China in combination to the energy techniques of Tibet. Although fundamental, it is an advanced type of Qi Gong as one begins to move internally; and through a structured series of practice sets, can quickly develop internal ability and understanding that improves both physical and psychological strength and eventual opening of the Yuen Qi Jewel (內元氣) hidden within the body.

 
*Medium Stages – Requires the student to have completed the Foundational Stages*

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/4.-Wing-Chun-Sinking-the-Bridge-Qi-Gong-Chum-Q-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Chum Q Qi Gong – 詠春尋橋丹田氣功**

Leveraging the building blocks of the Foundational Stages, the student is applying the Qi to their movements and allowing it to blossom in to their martial arts training. Where Small Thought is a Yin Style course, Chum Q is a Yang Style course introducing the student to Dong Qi. So through the correct application of the Dan Tien, the student learns to develop and apply the Qi, and in turn can produce results using ‘internal’ strength rather than ‘external’ force.

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/5.-Wing-Chun-Piercing-Hands-Qi-Gong-Bil-Ji-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Bil Ji Qigong – 詠春標指丹田氣功**

All the skills from the previous stages are used to fine tune the student’s martial ability to generate Faat Ging or Inch Force and applying this new skill to devastating short-range simultaneous attack and defense techniques. The student will begin to deeply understand how Internal Qi Gong combining Yin and Yang of the previous courses, is the true source of power in advanced Kung Fu (功夫). Thus, proficiency in martial arts is not determined by the level of difficulty or complexity of forms or styles, but instead depends on the nature of the force employed.

*Advanced Stages – Requires the student to have completed the Medium Stages*

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/6.-Wing-Chun-Wooden-Dummy-Qi-Gong-Mook-Yan-Jong-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Wooden Dummy Qi Gong – 詠春木人樁丹田氣功**

Through the discovery of the Secret Qi Door from earlier stages, the student will learn how to bring on more Qi, and continue to use their developed Internal Qi Gong (內氣功) skills to apply force correctly against the Wing Chun Wooden Dummy (詠春木人樁). This is more than simply physically conditioning the human body, as the student is learning how to apply the Qi effectively to hit the Wooden Dummy in the correct way to avoid injury, whilst simultaneously use the Wooden Dummy to accelerate their Internal Qi development.

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/7.-Wing-Chun-Long-Pole-Qi-Gong-Luk-Dim-Boon-Quan-small.jpg">**Wing Chun 6 and a Half Point Pole Qi Gong**

Leveraging the Secret Qi Door from earlier stages, the student can then learn to direct this force into the Wing Chun Long Pole for devastating attack and defense movements generating explosive power, whilst improving their structural foundations to their extremum.


<img style="float: left;" src="/img/8.-Wing-Chun-Butterfly-Knives-Qi-Gong-Bat-Jum-Dao-small.jpg">**Wing Chun Butterfly Knives Qi Gong**

Leveraging the Secret Qi Door from earlier stages, the student can then learn to direct this force into the Wing Chun Butterfly Swords for devastating attack and defense movements generating explosive power.
