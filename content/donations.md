## All Donations Welcome
Jordan has spent tens of thousands of dollars in the learning of this wonderful art. He has made a bodhisattva vow to assist all beings in the learning of meditation, qi gong, healing, kung fu and virtue. As such, he provides a majority of the material for the benefit of this generation and the next for free.

In order to keep these resources online, we only ask for a small donation, such as what you would pay for a cup of coffee, as all donations go towards the the online support of web hosting obligations and further improvements in course material.
