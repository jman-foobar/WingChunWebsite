<h2 id="roots-in-shaolin">Roots in Shaolin</h2>

<p>Legend says that 500 years ago during the Ming Dynasty (明朝) in mainland China, the Abbess Ng Mui (五梅) was one of the Five Elders of the Shaolin Temple (少林寺). The Five Elders included the Grand Master Ji Shim (至善禪師), Bak Mai with White Eyebrows (白眉道人), Fung Dao Tak (馮道德), Miu Hin (苗顯) and Ng Mui. Ng Mui reportedly lived outside of the temple in her own hut, where she met privately with these masters learning the secretive Kung Fu (功夫) and Qi Gong (氣功) knowledge of Shaolin. From a strong foundation in Shaolin, Ng Mui visited other Spiritual Universities across China and Tibet and assimilated the best of the best, and created a more advanced fighting system and program of Qi Gong (氣功) development that had never been seen in history. This system is called Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春氣功).</p>

<h2 id="lineage">Lineage</h2>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/img/LineageLite.jpg">
The legend tells of how a local warlord heard about a beautiful young bean curd girl named Yim Wing Chun (嚴詠春). When seeing her for the first time, the warlord immediately tried to force her into marriage, but as she didn’t want to marry the warlord, she decided to prolong the time in to marriage with a wager. She set up a challenge that the warrior would have to beat her in a martial contest one year from the day. Since he thought he’d have no trouble in beating her, he accepted the challenge.</p>

<p>Due to her worry about the martial contest and the warlord taking her by force in one years’ time, Wing Chun would often discuss this matter with her customers at her bean curd shop. During one of these talks, Ng Mui who would visit Wing Chun to buy her bean curd, overheard Wing Chun explaining her dire situation – At the time, Wing Chun did not know that the Ng Mui was an abbess of Shaolin and knew Internal Kung Fu.</p>

<p>The abbess took pity on the young girl and decided to teach her the newly created Kung Fu and fast track Qi Gong training. So the abbess, Ng Mui invited Wing Chun to train in private and Wing Chun learnt the newly developed fighting system. This was only possible due to Ng Muis’ advancements made in Qi Gong (氣功), Wing Chun’s previous knowledge of Kung Fu, and also her commitment to train continuously during that time.</p>

<p>Since the new fighting system was designed to overcome physical brute strength like that of the warlord, on the day of the contest, Wing Chun successfully defeated her physically bigger and stronger opponent and did not have to enter into a forced marriage. In honour of her win over the warlord and her own humility, the Abbess Ng Mui named the newly created fighting system after her first student, Wing Chun (詠春).</p>

<h2 id="red-boat-opera">Red Boat Opera</h2>

<p><img style="float: left;" src="/img/Lineage-Masters1.jpg">
Years after her famous battle with the warlord, Wing Chun married Leung Bok Chau. During their time as a married couple, Wing Chun taught Leung Bok Chau, the newly created system of Qi Gong (氣功) and Kung Fu (功夫). Later, in order to learn the Butterfly Knives and the 6 and a Half Point Pole, Leung Bok Chau traded his knowledge of Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春氣功) with actors of the Red Junk Opera, who were all specialists in Kung Fu and outcasts from the Shaolin Temple. The three actors of the Red Junk Opera were Leung Lan Kwai, Wong Wah Bo and Leung Yee Tai.</p>

<h2 id="lineage-masters">Lineage Masters</h2>

<p>Focusing only on my lineage, Wong Wah Bo later taught Leung Jan. Leung Jan taught his son, Leung Bik, and his neighbour, Chan Wah Shun the Money Changer. It has been reported that in order to make things fair, the neighbour Chan Wah Shun, was not taught the complete system by Leung Jan, due to him being a far bigger opponent to Leung Jan’s son, Leung Bik. Nonetheless, Chan Wah Shun was a strong man and a very dangerous fighter who stayed in China, whilst Leung Bik left for Hong Kong after his father had passed away.</p>

<h2 id="grandmaster-yip-man">Grandmaster Yip Man</h2>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/img/YipMan.jpg">
Great Grandmaster Yip Man (葉問宗師) was born in Foshan, China, and always had a keen interest in Kung Fu. At the age of 13, he was accepted and taught by Chan Wah Shun in the fighting system of Wing Chun. At the age of 15, he moved to Hong Kong to study at St Stephen’s College, where he met Leung Jans’s son, Leung Bik. Afterwards, he became Leung Bik’s disciple, and for a number of years he trained intensively before returning to his home town of Foshan, China.</p>

<p>At the age of 24, Great Grandmaster Yip Man became a policeman and also taught a small number of students on the side. Much later in his life during 1949, he returned again to Hong Kong where he lived a relatively poor life as a Kung Fu master. Prior to Great Grandmaster Yip Man, Wing Chun had only ever been taught to a limited number of students and passed along from master to disciple. But due to his sharing, selfless, and kind personality, he had a modern idea to share the art with the whole of mankind. As such, there are now over 3 million people in the world learning Wing Chun across multiple countries.</p>

<h2 id="from-hong-kong-to-australia">From Hong Kong to Australia</h2>

<p><img style="float: left;" src="/img/GregChoiYipMan.jpg">
Grandmaster Gregory Choi began learning from Great Grandmaster Yip Man (see picture left) as a closed door student over a 5 year period before moving to Sydney, Australia. During the 1970′s, Gregory Choi returned to Hong Kong where Great Grandmaster Yip Man instructed him to open his own school and pass along the tradition. Gregory Choi returned to Australia and opened his school at Chinatown in Sydney, which he ran for several years.</p>

<p>After teaching for 5 years to fulfill his master’s wishes, Sifu Greg Choi closed the school. Through this period, Grand Master Choi did not disclose the internal aspect of Qi Gong (氣功), teaching only the superficial aspects of Wing Chun focused on the Martial Art. He also never appointed a successor during this entire period although a number of his students have gone on to teach.</p>

<p>In 2010 Greg decided to find a successor to his lineage and pass along his previously hidden Qi Gong knowledge. He openly invited many students to train, but only a handful were interested.</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present Day</h2>

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/img/profile.jpg">
I, Sifu Jordan Del-Grande began my studies in martial arts at an early age but became serious in Wing Chun during 2006 in New York City attending the Moy Yat lineage down in Chinatown. When I returned home to Sydney, Australia I continued training with a local Sydney school several times a week within the Chu Shong Tin lineage under Sifu Susana Ho.</p>

<p>In 2010, Sifu Gregory Choi accepted me as a closed door student where I trained intensively with him in Brisbane, Australia. In 2012, after much hard training, I was endorsed as a Sifu of Wing Chun Ling Tung Qi Gong (詠春靈通氣功) by Sifu Greg Choi and appointed his Yut Doi Chung Si.</p>

<p>Later, I injured myself from the intense training program and developed severe chronic pain. During this time of intense physical pain, Greg and I separated as teacher and student. Since that time Greg and I have mutually departed ways and I am in no way affiliated with him.</p>

<p>Luckily through fate and much determination, I have met real healing, qi gong and kung fu masters with genuine hearts and have been able to escape the majority of my chronic injuries and resume my training. I have also continued my studies surpassing my expectations, but remaining a Wing Chun specialist at heart.</p>

<p>Through these empirically tested teachings, I decided to continue the Wing Chun Qi Gong school. A school dedicated to teaching the three part aspects of Health, Kung Fu and Spirituality providing everyone a way to self improvement.</p>
