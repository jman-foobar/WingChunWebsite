<h2 id="discover-qi-gong-stage-quickly-don-t-wast-your-time">Discover Qi Gong Stage Quickly – Don’t wast your time</h2>

<p>Qi Gong can best be translated as Life Force Cultivation. This Force or Qi can be used for multiple purposes, but within the Wing Chun courses, it is used for either Healing or Hurting (‘Martial Art’). Hence, Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春氣功) is a the Way of Understanding Life Force and its application to Healing and Martial Arts.</p>

<p>The Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春靈通氣功) course is direct, simple and scientific. It is non-dogmatic, non-sectarian and non-denominational, focusing more on techniques with the uniquely created stage-by-stage training program to quickly direct students to discover the Secret Qi Door within one year and advance to discovering the Jewel of Qi Gong hidden within every human body.</p>

<p>These stages in the course are just like a computer system where you need to click on the first folder to get to the sub-folder, and then click on the sub-folder to get to the next sub-sub-folder. The Secret Qi Door is definitely not the end of discoveries, but only the beginning, and the cultivation of one’s Qi can only grow with further practice and with each new stage in development.</p>

<p>Below are some known benefits of practicing Qi Gong…</p>

<h2 id="health-longevity-looking-younger-and-the-removal-of-bodily-toxins">Health, Longevity, Looking Younger and the Removal of Bodily Toxins</h2>

<p>The keys to Health, Longevity, and Looking Younger are correct breathing, posture and the removal of free radicals from the body and increasing the levels of antioxidants. General movement such as exercise cannot eradicate these free radicals and do not encourage people to breathe correctly for strength, so the importance of Qi Gong practice, although not yet evident to most people, is a necessity in a modern life.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-qigong-even-more-important-in-today-s-world">Why is Qigong even more important in today’s world?</h3>

<p>A modern issue that we all face today is the amount of chemicals found in food products. As such, buying food in this day and age is very important. For example, in Australia if you go to buy fruit and the bar code begins with an 8, then be careful since this identifies food that was made to grow faster through genetic engineering (GMO). It’s best to always leave this type of food alone.</p>

<p>Another issue is the number of fast food options available in combination with the consumption of people’s time at work. With less time available to dedicate time to cook fresh and healthy food, it’s all too easy to opt out for the fast food option or certain unhealthy pre-packaged food. Unfortunately, it is exactly this type of fried, greasy, high in fat or sugar, and artificial additives taken into the body that increases the level of free radicals heightening the cells oxidative damage. The fats and sugars not only make one obese, they can also damage internal organs like the heart and brain over time, increase blood pressure, shorten one’s life, which can be seen through faster aging, where one gets more wrinkles, saggy skin, skin spots, etc.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done-to-reverse-these-harmful-effects">What can be done to reverse these harmful effects?</h3>

<p>Since people cannot be separated from their diet, the chemicals in food often enter the body and rarely leave. That’s why one needs to be correctly educated about their diet, the need to find something to protect their health and why Qi Gong is a necessity!</p>

<p>Cleansing these harmful toxins from the body occurs when the Qi is able to flow freely through the body’s meridians. This speeds up metabolism, fosters natural healing and flushes the body of harmful substances, such as free radicals. It also promotes healthy cell regeneration and the reduction in the variation of defective cells. Not only that, it also slows down aging making you look many years younger than your actual age. This is also how Qi Gong produces normal blood pressure and eradicates free radicals in the system to name only a few of its amazing benefits.</p>

<h2 id="achieve-high-intelligence-prevent-dementia">Achieve High Intelligence &amp; Prevent Dementia</h2>

<p>University studies have shown that a Qi Gong practitioner’s brain structures are different to non Qi Gong practitioners. This is because Qi Gong helps the functioning of the prefrontal lobe. The prefrontal lobe is a critical area of the brain located in the middle at the front of the two main left and right lobes. The prefrontal lobe is involved in the executive functioning of the overall bodily and mental faculties. So a healthier more powerful prefrontal lobe gives one a heightened attention span, greater intelligence, evolved planning skills, increased analytical skills and a heightened memory. In short, you become smarter on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Increasing the strength and health of one’s prefrontal lobe also decreases the likelihood of developing mental diseases, such as, depression, dementia, or Parkinson’s. The better one’s prefrontal lobe also allows one to deal with other people in the right manner to avoid trouble, reduce hassles in life and in extreme cases save one’s life. Think of it as not only helping IQ (intelligent quota) but also EQ (emotional quota), but much more.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-want-to-be-smarter">Do you want to be smarter?</h3>

<p>Who doesn’t want to be smarter? Intelligence gives you a massive leg up in this world. You can be better than other students in high school, you can get the necessary marks to enter university, you can become one of the top students at university to graduate with honors, you can be one of the best employees at work, or better still, be your own boss and run a successful business. Additionally, you can also improve the relationship with yourself, immediate family, co-workers and society.</p>

<p>If you would like any one of these improvements then Wing Chun Qi Gong can offer it to you. The secret? All you need to do is practice.</p>

Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583900">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583900</a></em></p>

<h2 id="reduce-stress">Reduce Stress</h2>

<p>It is now well known and accepted that most serious diseases are derived from stress. Stress can slowly weaken one’s health, ranging from accelerating aging, weight gain, mental exhaustion, heightened blood pressure, nerve damage, internal organ stress, and stress is a major cause of cancer. The pressure is mostly because of a tired brain attaching and holding on to negative mental perceptions. Since our mind and body are interconnected by Qi, these negative emotions and thoughts impact the body’s Qi, which then ceases to run smoothly, leading to blockages that manifest as disease within the body.</p>

<p>Qi Gong practitioners in comparison to common people have a better attitude and can more easily learn to release the tired brain precisely because Qi Gong exercises require a cheerful mood to forget the discursive thoughts (i.e. over usage of the left hemisphere brain).</p>

<p>For example, in Wing Chun Laughing Qi Gong, students can learn how to really laugh, not an imitation of laughter, but from a genuine smiling heart. The laughter is a conductor to release negative moods and it can lead people to better face all the cumbersome things from the outside world, so that when under pressure, emotional responses resulting in stress are not acted upon and one can remain at a place of calm.</p>

<h2 id="attain-penetrative-strength-protection">Attain Penetrative Strength &amp; Protection</h2>

<p>By the correct application of the Qi through Internal Qi Gung or Nei Gung (內氣功), one will demonstrate superhuman strength that cannot be achieved through physical muscle force alone. In addition, when the Qi runs freely through the 12 major meridians and 8 extra meridians, one will have an internal protection allowing them to strike solid objects with a pain threshold far greater than the average person. This is far different than simply conditioning the hands hitting bricks over time or using sticks to deaden the skin cells. Conditioning the body in such a blunt manner is a very superficial form of training and requires no Internal Qi Gong (內氣功) knowledge.</p>

<p>A key difference of Wing Chun Qi Gong is that the effort one puts into their training is exponentially returned in the results. This strength is different from what can be seen in hard or external forms of Qi Gong where it can be a 1-to-1 relationship between input and output. The hard type of training also involves a lot of physical effort, almost impossible for the older generation and doesn’t provide the highest return on a persons effort in comparison to the Internal Qi Gong (內氣功). Only through Internal Qi Gong or Nei Gong (內氣功) can a smaller individual, such as a woman or small man effectively counter attack a much larger opponent. Without the Internal Qi Gong, this is almost impossible without a significant amount of physical training – By significant I am implying no less than 3 hours a day training.</p>

<h2 id="prevention-of-cancer">Prevention of Cancer</h2>

<p>Western studies have found that the average person produces 30 million cancerous and mutated cells on a daily basis, but these cancer cells like to hide within the body and not show themselves when the body is healthy. Why? Just like criminals who do not come out when the police are patrolling, the cancer cell doesn’t like to come out when the white blood cells are active. But when people eat too much junk food, don’t exercise, are frightened or scared, worried, stressed, don’t drink plenty of clean water and don’t do good Qi Gong, then these are the types of conditions that the cancer cell loves and is why it is difficult to eradicate all the cancer cells in the body. Under these ideal conditions for the cancer cells, it is as if the police are no longer on patrol and once the number of cancer cells reaches above a certain threshold, the individual is diagnosed with ‘cancer’.</p>

<p>Qi Gong has been scientifically tested and proven not only too maintain a healthy body, but also act as a natural preventative to serious diseases, such as cancer. The studies found that Qi Gong practitioner’s cancerous cells remain stable and do not exponentially increase. This is because proper Qi Gong makes the inside strong, producing non-ideal conditions within the body for the cancer cell. It also naturally encourages the production of more healthy cells, so either the cancer cell is not produced, is destroyed early on in the life cycle, or living cancer cells become dormant and eventually die.</p>

<h2 id="palliate-addictions">Palliate Addictions</h2>

<p>Negative addictions to thoughts, food, cigarettes, caffeine, alcohol, drugs, sex, power, money, shopping, gambling, TV, pornography, video games, exercise, work, etc. usually result in a repeated pattern of behaviour with impaired to no control from the individual despite the consequences.</p>

<p>In Wing Chun Qi Gong (詠春靈通氣功) we have a simple, interesting and enjoyable Qi Gong so the people practice daily and for the rest of their life. The techniques improve the brain circuitry, strengthening the prefrontal lobe and altering emotions to be more harmonious. Because the practice is enjoyable, the student will practice more and the original negative addictions can gradually lose there appeal.</p>
